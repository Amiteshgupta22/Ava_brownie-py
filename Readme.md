1. When you deposit eth to ave you get weth in your wallet on which you get some interest
2. Interfaces are used to interact with function of contract, interfaces contain only functions.
3. We cant use eth directly in aave to borrow or lend we need ERC20 token for this
4. When we deposit eth to weth contract it mint eth in 1:1 ratio.
5. Depending upon which network you use your weth contract address will change because same contract is deployed on different testnet has different address.

6.For withdrawing the weth you need to hit the withdraw button on contract in etherscanor just write a withdraw function in code.

{Note very Imp point}
Process:
1. convert eth to weth
2. deposit eth you will get aETH
3. You will get interest on it.
4. Now if you borrow some token then your ethwithdrawable will reduce according to amount you borrowed.
